Interviewer - Aleksandr Bobinsky
<br>
Interviewee - Lionel Illychowich
<br><br>
Date: April 7th, 2716
<br><br>
B - Good evening everybody, I welcome you to the Galaxy with Bobinsky, tonight with a very special guest, the ever elusive captain Illychowich. As you might notice this isn't my usual set as I'm infact onboard PPB Gloryhound, now Captain if we could get to the interview.
<br>
I - Please, call me Leo we are big family here no need for this corporate speak, if you don't mind I will call you Alex.
<br>
B - Completely fine by me, I always like to make my guests comfortable and I don't mind this one bit. Leo, how did you come into possesion of such impressive fleet and cohort, surely it had to take years to build this all up.
<br>
I - It's very simple Alex anyone can do it, all you need is connections and knowing where to press people. Not everyone is good at everyhing but more heads know more together, I won't bore you with details but all of this started over some vodka and I hope if it comes to end it's the same way.
<br>
B - Very nice, I won't push it I'm even glad to be here, details are fools errand anyway, um, let me see. Ah, a reader of mine asked what is the legion supposed to represent, your name and values if you could summarize it for the curious out there.
<br>
I - This is first time I say this but this name comes from a lost poker game, some failing PMC owner put up remnants of his company and I got full house on him, rest is history. But unlike him I run this as refuge for other what governments like to call, lowlives, maybe in a dream all of these I would give my life for. Great people, it's almost as if I was born for this.
<br>
B - So you treat this fleet as your personal responsibility towards less fortunate people to help them throw off the yoke of opressive governments ?
<br>
I - No no no that would make me a revolutionary, I am simply a visionary we all work towards an utopia a dream. I would also be kidding myself if I said we don't help the regimes from time to time, but building something of this scale requires some sacrifices.
<br>
B - Are you referring to the recent research station Gamma attack ? The one HexaOptimum accused you of commiting.
<br>
I - They accuse me of a lot of things, some might be true some might not be, this one in particular is purely a political stunt to get investors on their side or PentaOptium for all I care. Diego is paper dragon just like that entire rot on Tau Ceti, all the artificial technology in the world couldn't stop some ragged pirates from taking over one of their stations.
<br>
B - How do you explain that they used your equipment then and some reportedly even spoke your as it was labeled by Martian authorities 'Lingo', don't take this as accusation it's just that evidence is stacked against you.
<br>
I - Our equipment is nothing rare or special, anyone on Earth can find vaults full of this armour scattered around, not to mention many of our vessels had to be scuttled so anyone in galaxy could have it. The rest is just AI generated nonsense, I would never greenlight such a suicidal attack.
<br>
B - Very well last question if you don't mind Leo, there are rumours your fleet is on it's way towards outer space far away from Terran or Coalition authorities.
<br>
I - No comment, if we are getting into that territory I think this interview is over mister Bobinsky, please follow my first officer to the airlock, he will escort you back to your shuttle.
<br>
B - I didn't mean to offend Captain I was merely asking a question, but I won't intrude on your vessel any longer if you wish so.
<br>
I - Misha [unable to be transcribed due to language error]
<br>
B - This is Bobinsky signing out for today folks!
