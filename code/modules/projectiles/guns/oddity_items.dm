/*Mastercraft weapons are rare rewards from dungeons and other places that are hard to get to via difficulty.
These weapons should be 'reasonable' in terms of their balance; they can be VERY strong but should not be a 1-shot machine on players or boss-tier mobs.
The idea behind these weapons is that they are 'one-of-a-time' or single batch production limited edition weapons. Oddity weapons refers to Noble background weapons. - Rebel0*/
