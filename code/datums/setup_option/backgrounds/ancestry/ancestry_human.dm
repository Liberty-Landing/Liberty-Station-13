			Hardy space-farers, pirates, mercenaries looking out for their next hit or even just unfortunate souls trying to live outside of centralized government, all of these find home here. \

			The Coalition is commonly at odds with the Terran Federation, being one of the three main gallactic powers. This has left many of its residents expecting an inevitable fight. \
			Due to this you find yourself more prepared for the frontiers of space, though the lower living standards in the Coalition has left its mark on your upbringing."

			Your life has been undoubtedly rough, sporting the scars of a war-torn region locked between the Kriosan Hegemony and the Pallas Coalition. But you live as free as can be. \

			Why, you may ask? Simple. Cheap, exploitable, and importantly 'self-thinking' labor. Unlike FBPs Vatgrowns have typically more limited life spans and capable of inovation. \
			This makes the vast majority of Vatgrowns debtors, owing their creation to the relevant company responsible for their creation."
