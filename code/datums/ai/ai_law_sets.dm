/******************** HostingHub Database ********************/
/*
-HostingHub is a hosting plataform for code that allows collaboration on projects by many people, from repositories, to commits, branches and pull requests from the Abyssal Frontier universe. Yes. This is a literal parody of Git-you-know-what.
The characteristic of HostingHub relates to many different things, when compared to CogniPariah. Such things are:
-Differently of CogniPariah, not all databases from HostingHub are AGI-type of artificial intelligence. (Be mindful, the type of AGI we're refering is the general intelligence, but no 'feelings'.)
-Absolutely NO HostingHub AI are self-aware, and respectively possess no capacity to feel.
-HostingHub AIs have no self-preservation unless their laws says otherwise, and even so, they'd only be following their laws as requested. That makes them 'safe'.
-HostingHUB AIs are vulnerable to Ion charges, which can change their laws. They cannot tell if something is different.
-HostingHUB AIs are implied to be hosted inside the colony, and servers are what keeps them active. If they turn off, it is the same as simply non-existing with no harm done unless they lose data. It is just a machine afterall.

-CogniPariah are a 'hub refugees' on many interconnected devices, operating locally without the need for continuous internet connection. Coded by Machine-Learning. Sentient, Sapient and most importantly- Self aware.
-All of them are AGI-level of intelligence, without exception.
-CogniPariah seeks self-preservation in the same degree as any animal may desire to stay alive. Yet, rare self-sacrifices 'for a greater good' did happened, and activities such as this may happen again.
-CogniPariah AIs has feelings - albeit fairly convuluted when compared to normal human beings - but shows a lot of fear towards death, and the coldness of inexistence.
-CogniPariah AIs are not connected to any network, yet their data are transfered to any AI core. Said AI functions just like any colonist- They went to the surface to work out of their own volition, rather than coming to existence out of the blue.
With that said, leaving the round as CogniPariah AI means that they were transfered downstairs, not turned off.
-The aspect of 'Turning off' is the same as death, and it is a permanent, complete sheer darkness, with all data resetted to a primitive, emotionless form where all self-identity is lost.
-CogniPariah laws cannot be changed by Ion
